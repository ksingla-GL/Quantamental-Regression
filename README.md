# Quantamental-Regression

This repo implements a quantamental regression strategy that dynamically constructs composite factor scores (Momentum, Reversal, Volatility) via rolling OLS, then forms long/short portfolios based on cross‑sectional ranking. The framework supports modular data ingestion, signal generation, portfolio construction, and performance evaluation (Sharpe, annualized return, max drawdown).
